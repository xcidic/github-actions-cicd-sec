The scanning with the Unified Agent in Mend includes both SCA and SAST. 
SCA stands for Software Composition Analysis, and SAST stands for Static Application Security Testing. 
SCA is the process of identifying, assessing, and managing the security risks associated with the software 
components used in an application. SAST is the process of analyzing source code to find potential security vulnerabilities.

The Unified Agent scans your codebase for open source components and their licenses. 
This information can then be used to identify potential security risks, such as:

* Vulnerabilities in open source components
* License compliance issues
* Security misconfigurations

The Unified Agent can perform both SCA and SAST scanning. 
This makes it a powerful tool for organizations that want to improve the security of their software.

Here is a table that summarizes the differences between SCA and SAST:

|                       SCA                                         |                           SAST                                    | 
| Analyzes software components                                      | Analyzes source code                                              |
| Can identify security risks associated with software components   | Can identify potential security vulnerabilities in source code    |
| Can be used to identify license compliance issues                 | Can be used to identify security misconfigurations                |
| Can be performed manually or using automated tools                | Can only be performed using automated tools                       |
